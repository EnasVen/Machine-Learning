# Machine Learning
Some basic ML models through scikit-learn with my learning notes !

## Supervised Learning
> Linear Regression  
> Polynomial Regression  
> Ridge,Lasso,Elastic Net  
> Logistic Regression  
> kNN  
> Decision Tree  
> Naive Bayes  
> Random Forest
> SVM  


## Unsupervised Learning
> kMeans  
> EM  
> DBSCAN  

## Dimension Reduction
> SVD  
> PCA  
> t-SNE  

## Ensemble
> Bagging  
> Boosting  
> Stacking  

## Feature Engineering
> Data Exploration  
> Feature Cleaning  
> Feature Transformation  
> Feature Selection
